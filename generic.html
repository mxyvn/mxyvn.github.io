								<p><br>This Design Thinking Project is a part of SECP1513 Technology and Information Systems course. My team created a prototype of Smart E-Learning Hub, an advanced and upgraded version of the UTM e-Learning website.</p>
								<b>Overview: </b>EduPath UTM is an innovative smart learning hub designed to enhance the educational experience for students of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia  (UTM). Leveraging advanced technologies and Artificial Intelligence (AI) integration, EduPath UTM offers
								a comprehensive platform that caters to individual learning needs through a personalized approach.
								<p><br><b>Key Features: </b>
									<ol>
										<li>Virtual Assistant</li>
										<p>The virtual assistant is at the core of EduPath UTM, providing students with real-time support and guidance. It helps answer queries, manage schedules, and provide instant feedback on assignments, ensuring that students have a seamless learning experience.</p>
										<li>Personalized Learning Path (PLP)</li>
										<p>EduPath UTM offers customized learning paths tailored to each student's academic needs and progress. By analyzing performance data, the system suggests relevant resources, courses, and activities that align with students' goals and learning styles.</p>
									</ol>
								<b>Reflection: </b><br>Throughout this process, I have learned the importance of adaptability and the power of collaboration. Working with my team, we encountered numerous obstacles, from technical glitches to user experience design challenges. However, each hurdle presented an opportunity to innovate and refine our vision. 
									The integration of AI features like the virtual assistant and personalized learning paths was particularly enlightening, as it underscored the potential of technology to transform education. <br><br>Reflecting on the impact of EduPath UTM, I am proud of how it addresses the diverse needs of students, making learning more accessible and engaging. 
									This project has not only enhanced my technical skills but also reinforced the value of user-centric design in creating meaningful solutions. EduPath UTM is more than just a platform; it's a testament to what can be achieved through dedication, creativity, and a commitment to improving the student experience at UTM.

							<h2>The INTERSPACE (Young Innovators Challenge 2021)</h2>
							<figure>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/yic2021.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption>Figure 1: The INTERSPACE introduction</figcaption></span></figure>
							<p>I was a leader of Team Vyrix for  Young Innovators  Challenge 2021. The INTERSPACE was a ground breaking project developed by our team, designed to address the critical need for effective social distancing in public spaces during the COVID-19 pandemic.
								As  the world grappled with the challenges of keeping people safe while allowing them to go about their daily activities, we sought to create a practical solution that would help individuals adhere to health guidelines and reduce the spread of the virus.
								<br><br>The INTERSPACE is a social distancing device built to detect the proximity of individuals in its vicinity and provide real-time feedback. Using sensors embedded in the device, it could detect when two people were within a predefined safe distance of each other.
								Upon detecting close proximity, the device  would activate an auditory alert - an alarm will be triggered to gently prompt individuals to adjust their positions and maintain a safer distance.
								<br><br><b>Reflection: </b><br>Throughout the project, we worked closely together as a team to design, develop, and test the INTERSPACE, iterating on the concept to ensure it met the needs of a post-pandemic world. The process of creating the device not only gave us valuable insights into problem-solving, 
								teamwork, and engineering design, but also highlighted the importance of innovation in response to global health crises. <br><br>The INTERSPACE exemplified our commitment to leveraging technology for social good and demonstrated how a simple, yet effective solution could make 
								a tangible impact on public health and safety. The project remains a proud accomplishment in our journey as innovators, and we believe it showcases the potential of creative, real-world problem solving to address pressing challenges faced by society.
