                                <p><b>Reflection</b><br>The first assignment which covered Set Theory and Logic and Relations and Functions enabled me to deepen my understanding for this fundamental topics. Collaborating with my group allowed us to explore
                                the interconnectedness of these concepts and their practical applications in Computer Science. We discovered few challenges while working on this assignment. The first one was translating complex logical statements into formal 
                                expressions and ensuring the accuracy of truth tables. This required meticulous attention to details. Next, for the second part was identifying the properties of relations and proving the functions characteristics.
                                Thankfully, we managed to overcame them through continuous peer feedback within group, as it helped refine our solutions and clarify any misconceptions.</p>

                                    A significant challenge was ensuring that we applied the correct formulas and understood the context of each problem. Questions involving conditional arrangements required careful consideration of both permutations and combinations.
                                    Through solving these problems, I have strengthened my ability to distinguish when to use permutations versus combinations. For example, understanding that permutations are used when order matters and combinations are used when it doesnâ€™t was crucial.
                                    The skills and knowledge gained from this assignment are directly applicable to various areas in data engineering, such as algorithm design and data analysis.
                                    Assignment 2 was a focused and enriching experience that enhanced my understanding of permutations and combinations, providing a strong foundation for more advanced studies and practical applications in my field.</p>
